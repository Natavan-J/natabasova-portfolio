  <h3>My Digital Home</h3>
  <p>
    This website is more than just a digital portfolio — it’s a cozy corner of
    my world. Each illustration you see is not just a pretty graphic, but a
    reflection of real details from my home — from the swing chair I love to the
    hanging plants that bring me calm. I wanted to bring that warmth and
    authenticity into the digital space. Here, I share my journey as a frontend
    developer and creative mind. From colorful UI design to solid Angular
    architecture — everything you’ll explore is crafted with care and
    personality. The purpose of this website is not only to showcase my work,
    but to express who I am through the things I love — calm corners,
    handwritten fonts, soft tones, and thoughtful experiences. I hope you enjoy
    browsing through this space as much as I enjoyed building it.
